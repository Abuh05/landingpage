                            If you have ever wondered how to trade and make profits CONSISTENTLY <br>
                            in the forex market, thenthis might be the most important article on Forex trading  you have ever come across in the last 10 years.
                            <br>
                             <br>

                            <h3 class="font-alt">Here’s why</h3>

                            You see, when it comes to the forex market, there has been a lot of misinformation and disinformation, and I am sad to admit that over 95% of the people who teach forex courses online today are putting out the wrong information.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is why after taking their courses you end up getting some temporary success, making a few dollars here and there, <strong>followed by one massive loss that wipes out your trading account.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <h3 class="font-alt">The bitter truth is that;</h3>

                            If you depend on Forex trading tutorials on youtube, you will bleed money like crazy

                            <br>

                    Now, take a look at this market entry strategy I shared with my students and they used to trade Gold on the 14th of March, 2022
                    </p>

                        Gold has been Bullish (increasing in price) since the Russia/Ukraine war and that was because of the fact that it is a safe Haven pair.

                            Meaning that in times of war or uncertainty in the world, investors protect their money by buying assets and gold is one of them.

                        <br>

                            But this week, I saw a pullback on Gold.

                            I waited to see if it would break the 1960 price point which was a critical area of support.

                            Once we got that break, we waited for a retest and then took our sell.

                            We were looking for a buy as USDCAD has been bullish/buying for the past couple of weeks.
